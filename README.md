 I am from Atlanta, Georgia. Currently I attend **Pivot Technology School** to get education in *Software Develop*. I am a true believer that in order to get anything you want out of life you must put in the equal amount of work required to obtain your vision. You should never try anything that you know you will not give 120% all the way through and through.
 
 Growth mindset to me means:

**1.Adaptable**

  1a. being able to adjust accordingly to a variety of situations

**2.Focused**

2a. being able to immerse yourself and finish anything you start successful or failure 

**3.Constant reflection**

3a. Always thinking about all past experiences and constantly taking a lesson from each failure or success 

**4.Self-awareness**

4a. Being honest to who you are and knowing who are and what you stand for

**5.Creativity**

5a. Being able to use multiple solutions to a single problem or activity 

**6.Being Open-minded**

6a. Being able to listen to others opinions or insight instead of being stubborn and stuck to one way

is merely a dream._
