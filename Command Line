# **Command Line** 
*Commmand line/terminal* - is a text based interface to the system. You enter commands by typing them on the keyboard.
The command line is also very *case sensitivite*.
* for example s and S can perform different actions 
Spaces in a command line are valid but still have to be careful with them.
* There are 2 ways to make spaces vaild 
1.) **Quotes('')("")** - anything inside quotes are considered a single item 
2.) **Escape Characters(\)** - backslash nullifies the special meaning of the next character     
### **Hidden Files/ Directories**
In Linux the files name begins with a (.) will be considered to be hidden
* -a = used with other commands to how hidden files
* Shells - are within the terminal, it's part of the opreating system defines how the terminal will behave after executing commands for you.
* **Bash(Bourne Again Shell)** - most common shell 
* Paths - a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system
**2 Types of Paths**
* Absolute Paths - specify a location in relation to the root directory. they can be identify them easily as they always being with a forward slash (/)
* Relative Paths specify a location in relation to where we currently are in the system. Doesn't begin with a slash. 
* **~(tilde)** - shortcut for your home directory.
* **.(dot)** - is a reference to your current directory.
* **..(dotdot)** - is a reference to the parent directory. can be used mulitple times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy.
* Root - the very top of the structure. it's denoted by a single slash (/).
* It can have subdirectories and son on. Flies can reside in any of these directories.
### **Commands** 
* **echo Command** - used to know which shell you are using, it will display a system variable stating your current shell.
* **pwd(Print Working Directory) Command** - tells you what your current/present working directory is.
* **ls(List) Command** - gives a list of whats in the current directory.
* **[] square brackets** - any thing in the bracket is optional and may run the command with/without it.
* **cd(change directory)** - to move around in the system. move to another directory.
* **file Command** - to find out what type of file a particular file is.

### **Directory Pathways**
* */etc* - Stores config filees for the system.
* */var/log* - Stores files for various system programs. (may not have permission to view everything is this directory)
* */bin* - the location of several commonly used programs.
* */usr/bin* - another location for programs on the system.
### **Everything is a file** 
examples: 
* a text file.
* a directory.
* your keyboard (one that the system reads from only).
* your monitor (one that the system writes to only).
**File Extension** - normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a ful stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is.
* Common Extensions.
* file.exe - an executeable file , or program.
* file.txt - a plain text file.
* file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
Linux the system actually ignores the extensions and looks inside the file to see what kind of file it is.
* example - file Sasuke.jpg could be renamed to Sasuke.text or just Sasuke and it will still be treated as an image.
Windows and oter systems the extension is an important and the system uses it to determine what type of file it is.
